# adna
An Open Source To-Do List Program: Built from the ground up to be lightweight, easy to run, easy to use, and awesome.

Any contributions you can make would be greatly appreciated!

### To Do
    - Rest API (I don't know how to do so securely and don't want to put anyone's data at risk, so need help on this)
    - Ability to import from other platforms (such as Remember the Milk)
    - More fields on tasks
    - Clean up code

### Donate
